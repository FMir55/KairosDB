  - import csv
  
  https://github.com/FMir55/KairosDB-Cassandra/blob/master/CQLSH_CMD.py
  
However,only 'CQL' command can be used in this way:
  ```
ALTER KEYSPACE
ALTER TABLE
ALTER USER
BATCH

CREATE KEYSPACE
CREATE TABLE
CREATE USER
DELETE
DROP INDEX
DROP KEYSPACE
DROP TABLE
DROP USER
GRANT
INSERT
LIST PERMISSIONS

REVOKE
SELECT

  ```
    
Note that 'cqlsh' command doesn't work:
```

```
